Systems Programming 
Assignment 2
Memory Allocation

For this assignment, we were asked to recreate the mymalloc and free function calls in the standard C library using a static char array of size 5000 to simulate a memory capacity of 5000 bytes.  More about this assignment can be found in our "readme.pdf" file, where there is an extensive description of the project and the programs' functionalities.
